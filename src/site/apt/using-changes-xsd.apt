Using the XML Schema Changes 2.0.0

  The Changes XSD is located {{{https://maven.apache.org/xsd/changes-2.0.0.xsd}here}}.

  Your favorite IDE probably supports validation and/or syntax highlighting for
  XML files by using XSD schemas. For this to work you need to specify the
  schema in your <<<changes.xml>>> file:

+-----+
<document xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/changes/2.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/changes/2.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/changes-2.0.0.xsd">

</document>
